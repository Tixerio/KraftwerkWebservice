This is a Simulator / Game to simply simulate the balance of producing and consuming in a powergrid.
Producing too much will push the frequency up, consuming too much will drag it down.
If the program ends up too far in either direction, it will result in a blackout and game over.

Therefore the aim is to find a good balance by playing using the endpoints
(See the swagger page for more detailed descriptions of those)
